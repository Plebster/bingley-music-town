# Shop

Our local instrument shop is [Windstruments](https://www.windstruments.co.uk/) at Crossflatts. 

Windstruments started in 1994 as a woodwind and brass instrument repair company. Since then we have expanded into one of the largest stockists of musical instruments in the UK adding a branch in Harrogate, known as Music House, as well as Bingley. 

# Re-home

Got an instrument you no longer need? 

We've found ourselves finding good homes for instruments people no longer need, and we're happy to keep on doing so.

[Get in touch]({% link contact.md %}) if you have an instrument looking for a new home.

So far we have found new homes for:

 * a keyboard that was found in a house clearance and went to the student of Wilsden music teacher Paul Janetta. 
* another keyboard that went to a family where the child learns at school but they could not afford an instrument at home.
* a classical guitar, drum sticks, and other bits and pieces that went to a gigging drummer, and the guitar went to a singer in a punk band who is also learning to play guitar.
