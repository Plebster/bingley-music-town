## Upcoming Meetings
(Steering group meetings are usually on the second Wednesday of the month)

**Steering Group Meeting** - Wednesday 11th January 2023, 7pm - 8pm, [The Brew House](https://whatpub.com/pubs/BRA/040/bingley-brew-house-bingley), Bingley.<br/>
Steering Group meetings are about the work that needs to be done to keep the organisation going.
Members and non-members are welcome to come along to observe and to meet up.

**Members Meeting** - Wednesday 8th February 2023, 5:30pm - 7pm at Cardigan House, Ferncliffe Road, Bingley, BD16 2TA.

This is a great chance for you to get your ideas on the table and really be part of shaping the future of music in Bingley. We want ALL of you there, every voice counts and all your ideas are needed for BMT to be truly community-led.

The event will be facilitated by Chis from Community Action Bradford And District and will help us prioritise our activities for the coming year.

If you can't get there but want to have an input, [contact us]({% link contact.md %}) with your ideas.
