### Steering Group
{% include steering-group.md %}

#### Mike Wheatley (Chair)
I have been playing in [Playing For Kicks<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](http://www.playingforkicks.co.uk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} covers band since 2010 and also organise a monthly [Open Mic<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.facebook.com/shedplannersbfd){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} night. I’ve lived in Bingley for 16 years. I want more people to know about all the great music that’s already happening, and encourage more music events in our town.

#### Becs Leighton (Secretary)
I teach piano, flute and music theory at [Becs Leighton<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.becsleightonmusic.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and I co-founded [Bradford and Airedale Youth Choir<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.bradfordandairedaleyouthchoir.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I am passionate about creating local opportunities in music for young people, because these experiences change futures.  

#### David Carpenter (Treasurer)
I have a background in community work and technology. I make music and sounds as [The Argent Grub<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://theargentgrub.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and I've lived in Bingley for over 20 years. My interest in the music town is geared towards anything that helps people make music for themselves.  

#### Anita Bašić
I am the founder and Musical Director of [Bradford Accordion Band (BAB)<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.bradfordaccordionband.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} who were established in 1997. My musical mission is to encourage as many people as possible to play an instrument they love, as part of a group. I have lived in the Bingley area for over 20 years and know that this Town has talent! 

#### Stephanie Laycock
 I am a lover of plays, musical theatre and pantomimes and have been performing with [Keighley Musical Theatre Company<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://keighleymtc.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} since 2005. I believe everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy and take part in music and the arts in their own town.
