  description: |
    Bradford Accordion Band (BAB) is a unique and diverse amateur musical
    group whose mission is to make great music, whilst having lots of fun! 
    We have been established since 1997 and our membership comprises 32
    accordion, keyboard, woodwind, strings and percussion players between
    the ages of 22 and 91. 

    BAB's repertoire is wide-ranging and includes classics, show music, pop, rock, folk and accordion originals. We perform
    regularly at venues across Yorkshire and have recently featured on BBC's
    'Look North' Programme. We are always looking to 'swell' our membership
    and we'd love to hear from you if you are a budding, competent or
    accomplished musician living in the Bingley area.

    Instrument loan scheme available.
