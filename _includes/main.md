Bingley Music Town brings together the people that care about music in our area, to make sure there are great musical opportunities for everyone now, and into the future.

There's already so much going on, and there's also loads of ideas about what else could happen in our town and district.

You can read (and add your knowledge and ideas to) this working document: [Bingley - A Music Town](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cIwYgCtF7vX98hy2NKenFRFFM3cwq3fK3-6qjdclAss/edit), with a big list of [What we've got already](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cIwYgCtF7vX98hy2NKenFRFFM3cwq3fK3-6qjdclAss/edit#heading=h.5vdluu5s24cx), and another list of [What's missing (that a Music Town might have)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cIwYgCtF7vX98hy2NKenFRFFM3cwq3fK3-6qjdclAss/edit#heading=h.azivrbtwiz2u).
